The action 'index' could not be found for RestaurantsController

this indicates that need to add an index method in our controller.
def index
  raise “Hello for the index action”
  @restaurants = Restaurant.all
end
AbstractController::ActionNotFound:

The action ‘new’ could not be found for RestaurantsController

this indicates that we should make new method in restaurants_controller.rb to go alongside our index method.

class RestaurantsController < ApplicationController
def new
end


rspec -error

Missing template restaurant/index

touch app/view/restaurants/index.html.haml

and then add text to it -     No restaurants yet!



ActionView::MissingTemplate:
this means our new method does’t have a view associated with it.
touch app/views/restaurants/new.html.haml

Failure/Error: fill_in ‘Name, with: ‘KFC’
Capybara:ElementNotFound:
Unable to find field “Name”

We are currently missing anything on that page to allow a user to submit restaurant details


Failure/Error: click_button 'Create Restaurant'
AbstractController::ActionNotFound:
The action ‘create’ could not be found for RestaurantsController

We need a create method!

Class RestaurantsController < ApplicationController
def create
  Restaurant.create(params[:restaurant])
  redirect_to ‘/restaurants'
end

Failure/Error: click_button 'Create Restaurant'
ActiveModel::ForbiddenAttributesError:
ActiveModel::ForbiddenAttributesError
We need to explicitly state which params we are going to allow our controller to accept, using permit.
lets create a utility method that does this for us and add it to our controller.

def restaurant_params
  params.require(:restaurant).permit(:name)
end

Restaurant.create( params [:restaurant] )
instead say
Restaurant.create(restaurant_params)

this tells rails that we should allow only the field labelled ‘name’ to be accepted by the form.
